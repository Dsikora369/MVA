The gradients are set to zero for all classes except the desired class (tiger cat), which is set to 1. This signal is then backpropagated to the `rectified convolutional feature map` of interest, where we can compute the coarse Grad-CAM localization (blue heatmap).\n",

I utilized the ResNet34 architecture in this experiment and employed Grad-CAM on the last BatchNormalization layer, which was read as the last convolutional layer. When the heatmaps created by Grad-CAM on the final bn2 layer and the last conv2 layer were compared, it was discovered that the bn2 layer produced much superior results.\n",

        "Based on the prior results, it is clear that the initial predictions connected with the first heatmaps are more accurate and related to the actual image in virtually all circumstances. But, in certain circumstances, the second or third forecasts outperform the first. The three heatmaps show that the network observes almost the same region for the prediction for most of the samples. The projected animals in each of these samples are members of the same mammalian family and share similar traits. However, some examples show strange results, for example for image 8, the three heatmaps show that the network does not focus on the same locations for all predictions. In first 2 times the network concentrates on the foreground. Yet, in the third one it concentrates on the animal's back. Nevertheless, some incorrect identification was present during the experiment. For instance, image 13 depicts a case in which the network fails to detect the animal, as evidenced by the heatmaps. In all cases, the network focuses on the border regions outside of the animal's real position. In conclusion, Grad Cam is a useful tool for learning about the network's internal operations and the factors it considers when generating predictions. We can see changes in the network's predictions and how they relate to certain portions of the input image by evaluating the heatmaps. Grad Cam was crucial in exposing how the network distinguishes between animal species and breeds within the same family by identifying the distinct traits that the network focuses on throughout the prediction phase in our specific challenge."
